    "text": "The right to protest and express your opinions is one of the most basic and important rights in the United States. Protests play an important role in preserving democracy by raising awareness and bringing about change. Recognizing the historical and central importance of protests and demonstrations, the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects your right to protest, assemble, and petition."
