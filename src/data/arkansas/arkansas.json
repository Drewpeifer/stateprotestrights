Here are some tips on what to do if you are confronted by a police officer or another public official during a protest. Keep this card handy! If you have an encounter with the police, you can protect yourself and your rights. If you believe that your rights have been violated, please contact an attorney and the ACLU."

However, police can't legally arrest you for refusing to provide your name unless you are suspected of criminal activity, or your identification is needed to protect officer safety or resolve whatever reasonable suspicions prompted the stop.
