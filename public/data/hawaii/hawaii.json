Expressive Activity includes, but is not limited to, public oratory and the distribution of literature."

            "The right to protest government actions publicly is protected by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. This right is not absolute. Even peaceful, non-violent protestors leading a march or waving picket signs may be subject to arrest if they trespass, harass or hinder others in their own lawful activities. If your protest involves several people, it may require a permit (which the government may not make too expensive or deny discriminatorily).",
            "This Toolkit is designed to provide some information to help you conduct a lawful protest. To better protect yourself from arrest, consult an attorney or the government agency in charge of the location where you want to protest ahead of time. Once a protest is underway, do not harm others or put them in danger, and obey the orders of the police. Never forget that attacking a police officer, even verbally, may itself be a crime."
